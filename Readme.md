Flushing style has as its main goal the production of clean, elegant content, that transmits sensations of order, purity, indifference and atemporality.

Unlike the natural world, where warm colours like orange or brown are dominant, Flushing uses a much colder colour spectrum. This allows any material using the style to immediately stand out for its contrast.

It is inspired by the neofuturist style of architects like Norman Foster or Santiago Calatrava.

Due to its thin and geometric lines, it becomes a minimalistic visual style, that abstains from getting close to reality, instead forming its own isolated space.

As a conclusion, it can be stated that Flushing does not strive for closeness, integration, or complicity with the user, but simply to transmit information in an efficient manner while keeping distances.
