Flushing style has as its main goal the generation of elegant and clean content that transmits feelings of order, purity, indifference and atemporality.

One of its most characteristic traits is that, besides the accent colours, most other colours are dominant towards blue, which favours a sense of coldness and disconnection from the natural world, where warmer colours like orange or brown are usually dominating.

It is inspired by the neo-futurist style of architects like Norman Foster or Santiago Calatrava.

Specifically, it happens to be a rather minimalistic visual style, somewhat disconnected from the imperfections of reality in order to form its own utopic isolated space.

Certainly, Flushing doesnâ€™t strive for closeness or integration, but simply to transmit information in an efficient and neutral way while keeping a safe distance from the user, even when that could be interpreted as haughtiness.
