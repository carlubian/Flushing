Flushing style has as its main goal the production of clean, elegant content, that transmits sensations of order, purity,
indifference and atemporality.

Unlike some representations of the future, where the world is made of rust, neon and dark alleys, the future of Flushing is
shining, clean, luminous and optimistic.

It is inspired by the neofuturistic style of architects like Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster or Santiago Calatrava.

As a conclusion, it can be stated that Flushing doesnâ€™t seek to get close to the user and their present world, but to 
transport them to a minimalist future from which to offer them information in an efficient and clean way, while trying to inspire
them.
